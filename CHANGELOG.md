# Changelog

All notable changes tracked here. This is a local/educational source mirror of Claude Code, not an official release stream.

## 2.1.91 — April 2, 2026

Applies the user-facing, tractable subset of the upstream 2.1.90 and 2.1.91 changelogs in a single bump.

### Applied in this local source tree

From upstream 2.1.90:

- Added `CLAUDE_CODE_PLUGIN_KEEP_MARKETPLACE_ON_FAILURE`: when set, a failed `git pull` during marketplace refresh keeps the existing cache instead of wiping and re-cloning. Useful for offline/restricted environments.
- Added `.husky` to the protected-directories list for `acceptEdits` mode (same protection as `.git`, `.vscode`, `.idea`, `.claude`).
- Removed `Get-DnsClientCache` cmdlet and `ipconfig /displaydns` flag from the PowerShell tool's auto-allow list (DNS cache privacy). Users who need these can add an explicit allow rule.
- `/resume` picker now filters out sessions created by `claude -p` or SDK transports (`sdk-cli`, `sdk-ts`, `sdk-py`) based on the session's stored `entrypoint`.

From upstream 2.1.91:

- MCP tool-result persistence override via `_meta["anthropic/maxResultSizeChars"]`: servers can annotate individual tools (e.g. DB-schema inspectors) to allow results up to **500K** characters to pass through without being persisted to a preview file.
- Added `disableSkillShellExecution` setting to disable inline shell execution (```! blocks and `!\`…\`` inline) in skills, custom slash commands, and plugin commands.
- `claude-cli://open?q=` deep links now accept URL-encoded newlines (`%0A` / `%0D`) for multi-line prompts. cmd.exe and AppleScript escape boundaries were updated to handle newlines safely (cmd.exe strips LF/CR to a space, AppleScript escapes to `\n`/`\r`).
- `/feedback` (and its alias `/bug`) stays visible in the slash menu when disabled; invoking it now prints an explanation (third-party provider, env var, policy, etc.) instead of silently disappearing.
- Bumped local source version to `2.1.91` (from `2.1.89`).

### Not applied (upstream-only internal fixes)

Skipped items that require forensic access to internals not faithfully present in the deobfuscated source, or are platform-specific infra fixes:

- `/powerup` interactive lessons
- Rate-limit dialog auto-reopen loop
- `--resume` prompt-cache miss regression (v2.1.69+)
- Edit/Write race with PostToolUse format-on-save hooks
- PreToolUse hooks emitting JSON to stdout + exit code 2 not blocking
- Collapsed search/read summary duplicated in scrollback on CLAUDE.md auto-load
- Auto-mode boundary honor-ing ("don't push", "wait for X")
- Click-to-expand hover colors on light terminal themes
- UI crash on malformed tool input, header disappearance on scroll, PowerShell tool hardening (trailing `&`, `-ErrorAction Break`, archive TOCTOU, parse-fail fallback)
- JSON.stringify MCP schema per turn, SSE linear-time streaming, long-session transcript write quadratic, /resume all-projects parallel load
- Transcript chain breaks on `--resume` with silent write failures
- `cmd+delete` on iTerm2/kitty/WezTerm/Ghostty/Windows Terminal
- Plan mode container restart recovery, `permissions.defaultMode: "auto"` JSON-schema validation, Windows version cleanup protecting rollback copy
- Improved `/claude-api` skill guidance content, Bun.stripANSI perf, shorter `old_string` anchors in Edit tool output
- Plugins shipping executables under `bin/` (requires plugin-system changes beyond this pass)

See upstream Anthropic Claude Code 2.1.90 / 2.1.91 release notes for full details.

## 2.1.89 — April 1, 2026

This release applies the **user-facing, tractable subset** of the upstream 2.1.89 changelog. See "Applied" and "Not applied (upstream-only)" sections below.

### Applied in this local source tree

- Added `CLAUDE_CODE_NO_FLICKER=1` environment variable (read at startup; wired through to the renderer as a feature flag).
- Added `MCP_CONNECTION_NONBLOCKING=true` for `-p` mode to skip the MCP connection wait entirely; bounded `--mcp-config` server connections at 5s at bootstrap time.
- Added `"defer"` permission decision to `PermissionBehavior` and a `PermissionDeferDecision` type (for headless `-p --resume` pause/re-evaluate semantics).
- Added `showThinkingSummaries` setting (defaults to `false` — opt-in to restore thinking summaries in interactive sessions).
- Rejected `cleanupPeriodDays: 0` in settings validation with an actionable error message.
- Fixed `Edit`/`Write` tools doubling CRLF on Windows and stripping Markdown hard line breaks (two trailing spaces).
- Improved collapsed tool summary to show "Listed N directories" for `ls`/`tree`/`du` instead of "Read N files".
- Improved `@`-mention typeahead to rank source files above MCP resources and include named subagents.
- Image paste no longer inserts a trailing space.
- Preserved task notifications when backgrounding a running command with Ctrl+B.
- `/usage` now hides the redundant "Current week (Sonnet only)" bar for Pro and Enterprise plans.
- `PreToolUse`/`PostToolUse` hooks now receive `file_path` as an absolute path for `Write`/`Edit`/`Read` tools.
- Bumped local source version to `2.1.89` (from `2.1.88`).

### Not applied (upstream-only internal fixes)

These items from the upstream changelog require forensic access to internals not faithfully present in the deobfuscated source, or are platform-specific infra fixes:

- Prompt-cache byte-level fixes, tool-schema cache bytes mid-session
- LSP server zombie-state restart
- Memory leak from large-JSON LRU cache keys
- Crash removing message from >50MB session files, out-of-memory on Edit of >1GiB files
- `~/.claude/history.jsonl` 4KB CJK/emoji boundary truncation
- Devanagari combining-mark truncation, iTerm2/tmux streaming jitter, main-screen render artifacts
- macOS `claude-cli://` deep-link handling, Apple-Silicon voice mic perms
- Shift+Enter on Windows Terminal Preview 1.25, PowerShell 5.1 stderr-progress misclassification
- Autocompact thrash loop detection, nested CLAUDE.md re-injection, prompt cache misses in long sessions
- Several smaller rendering/notification/prompt-history infra fixes
- `/buddy` April Fool's command (explicitly skipped per user)

See upstream Anthropic Claude Code 2.1.89 release notes for full details.
